    <h2>SMELL OF GRASS</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>During the Thanksgiving break, I went back to Toronto to visit my siblings and friends. On Sunday, I met up with my friend, Tiger, who showed me around the UofT campus. We walked past this lawn surrounded by campus buildings, which he told me had just recently opened after three years of construction. Standing on the lawn, I noticed a strong smell of nature from the grassâ€”very fresh and earthy.</p>

    <h2>CENTRAL PARK</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The smell of the grass from the lawn at UofT reminded me of Central Park in New York City, which is one of my favorite places to go during the weekends. I think that being in New York, this concrete jungle, I constantly need room to breathe and slow myself down from this fast-paced world. So, whenever I feel like I need a break, I would visit Central Park to inhale some fresh air from nature and just lay on the grass.</p>
