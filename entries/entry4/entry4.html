            <h2>Outdoor education</h2>

            <p>My high school has this little island up in  <a class="Temagami" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temagami" target="_blank">Temagami</a>  
                in the northern 
                part of Ontario, Canada, about 7-8 hours away from Downtown
                Toronto. Every students in our school are required to visit this island 
                during the fall of grade 9 and again in the winter of grade 10 and we 
                refer to these trips as Fall Temagami and Winter Temagami.<br></p>
            
            <h2>Fall Temagami</h2>
            <p> This trip happened right at the beginning of the school year and it is a canoe 
                trip. We started with a long bus ride, then they dropped us off, and we got on a 
                boat to get to the main campus on the Island where we learn some basic survival 
                skills and how to paddle a canoe even though most of my tripmates already knew how 
                because Canadians love camping. Then in the following days, it was all about canoeing 
                to different sites, setting up our tents, chopping woods, and cooking meals. At night, 
                we would sit around the campfire, chat, play card games (since the teachers took away 
                out phones), and gaze at the stars.</p>

            <h2>Winter Temagami</h2>
            <p> I just want to say that I love this trip and I enjoyed this adventure a lot. 
                When we got to the drop-off point, we had to trek 10 km to get to the 
                island because the lack was completely frozen. It took us 3 hours to get 
                there because the snow were THICK and very difficult to walk on. Our 
                guides then picked a site on top of the frozen lake buried under layers
                of snow, where we built the 
                <a class="Temagami" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinzhee" target="_blank">quinzhees</a> 
                , which is a snow shelter made 
                from a large pile of loose snow. We stayed there for a couple days and 
                I still remember my tripmates and I were freezing all the time since 
                Canadian winter's is super super cold plus there is no buildings or 
                skyscrapers to block the wind. So just like Fall Temagami, we spend our 
                nights gathering around the campfire to eat, chatting, playing games, 
                and basically doing everything around it.<br><br></p>
