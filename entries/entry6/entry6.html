        <h4>NYC PIZZA</h4>
        <p>Pizza is now one of my comfort food I would get whenever I feel stressed and needed a little bit of treat in New York. It smells like a delicious mix of fresh-baked bread, tomato sauce with herbs, melting cheese, and the unique aroma of different toppings. The smell of a freshly baked pizza gives a sense of comforting, especially in a winter evening. Something special about New York-style pizza is its thin and foldable crust and its large slice that always serves on a white paper plates and enjoying a slice while standing in the pizzeria or on the street is a true unique, yet iconic experience for many tourist who visit New York City.</p>

        <h4>Late Night Memories</h4>
        <p>I was not a big fan for pizza before I came to New York. If I had to pick between a burger or a slice of pizza, I would always go for a burger. However, after a year or so of being in the city, I started to enjoy eating pizza more and more. A part of that was because of the memories I have created associated with the pizza. 

            Near where I live there are two pizzerias which I usually get my pizza from. There are many evenings when I ended my evening classes and on my way back home, I stopped by one of them and grab a slice of freshly baked cheese pizza as a little treat for myself for finishing such long and exhausted days which hits differently from getting them on a normal day. It is the sense of accomplishments that makes me keep doing it and then stopping by a pizzeria gradually became my little habit that I do almost once a week.  </p>
