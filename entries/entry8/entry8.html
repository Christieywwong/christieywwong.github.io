<div class="paragraph">
    <p><mark>I have a weird habit;</mark> 
        Whenever I get a brand new book, the first thing I always do is put my nose close to the paper and inhale that distinctive scent. There's something about the smell of a fresh book that instantly evokes a sense of comfort and nostalgia. The smell of a book, especially an older one, has a very distinctive and somewhat musty odor. It is a
        <mark>combination of the paper's natural fibers and the ink used in printing. </mark>I particularly find the smell very comforting and pleasant, as it connected me with my memories of library.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="subtitle2">
    <h2>LIBRARY</h2>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Before owning a phone,       
        <mark>reading was my primary source of entertainment. </mark>
        During my kindergarten and elementary school years, my mom would take my brother and me to the public library near our school and home every week. We would spend our entire afternoons there, immersed in the world of books.<br><br>
        As I grew older, the library became 
        <mark>a place where I could escape from studying and completing homework.</mark>
         In middle school, I took on the role of a library assistant at my school's library, which provided a perfect excuse to avoid going straight home immediately after school. I remember my shifts were always with one of my friends on Fridays, which were typically quieter. So we found a corner behind those huge bookshelves that blocked the view of the senior library assistants and pretended to organize books. But in fact, we were just chatting and continually taking books from the shelves and putting them back. </p>
