            <h3>PETRICHOR</h3>
            <p>A term defined as "the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil" based on Wikipedia, 
                    which is probably my favourite smell. I always like rainy day. Not just because of the calmness 
                    and meditative sound of water drop hitting on the window, but because of the smell it brings along. </p>

            <h3>NEW YORK <br> ON A RAINY DAY </h3>
            
            <p>The rain smells slightly different in New York, 
                though, with a combination of smoke, marijuana, and 
                an earthly scent. When I stepped out of my apartment building 
                and was about to attend one of my evening classes, I noticed the smell
                of the fresh and clean air after a rain storm flushed everything away 
                30 minutes ago. I enjoyed this rare moment in New York's fresh 
                air. But not long after, I scented cigarette smoke and 
                marijuana odor, a familiar reminder that I 
                was in New York.

            <h3>Reminder of Home </h3>
            <p>In Hong Kong, where I grew up, we 
                have a lot of rain during summer. I would 
                say I spent almost half of my summer carrying an 
                umbrella just in case it started to pour rain. Therefore,
                I have many memories associated with the smell of rain, most of 
                which are delightful memories. My home in Hong Kong is on a hill. It 
                is a small and quiet hill with a relatively low population. Because of that, 
                there are tons of trees, plants, stray cats and dogs, and even wild animals 
                like monkeys living on the hill (sometimes they even swim in the pool of 
                our building). So you can imagine whenever it rains, there is always a 
                strong earthy scent in the air. Now, whenever I encounter the smell of 
                rain, it reminds me of the rainy days in Hong Kong when I would be 
                sitting on a couch, listening to the sound of the rain, and 
                enjoying this pleasant moment.
