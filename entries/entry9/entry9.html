        <div>        
            <p>Tiger Balm's smell is like a strong mix of menthol and camphor. When you open it up, it's got this sharp, wake-you-up kind of vibe. The menthol is cool and refreshing, like a burst of minty air. Then there's this subtle herbal thing in the background, like a hint of nature. It's not too loud, just hanging out and adding a bit of warmth. The whole smell is like a powerful hit of comfort.</p>

            <h2>SMELL OF MOM</h2>
        </div>
        <div>            
            <p>My mom always carries a small jar of Tiger Balm in her handbag, no matter what the occasion: when we're traveling, dealing with mosquito bites, or combating a stubborn headache. The familiar scent of Tiger Balm holds a special place in my memories, especially from my childhood. I remember how, when my siblings and I were small, she would apply it on us too. That distinctive aroma became synonymous with comfort, a scent that I associate with care and well-being.

                Now, as I've grown older, I find myself embracing this habit as well. Wherever I go, a small jar of Tiger Balm accompanies me. It's not just a practical item; it's a source of comfort and a connection to my past. Applying it brings back the warmth of my mom's care, and the smell, especially under my nose, has become a comforting ritual.</p>
