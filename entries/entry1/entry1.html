            <p>A term defined as "the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil" based on Wikipedia, 
                    which is probably my favourite smell. I always like rainy day. Not just because of the calmness 
                    and meditative sound of water drop hitting on the window, but because of the smell it brings along. </p>

            <h3>NEW YORK ON A RAINY DAY </h3></div>
            <div class="Text">
                <p>The rain smells slightly different in New York, 
                    though, with a combination of smoke, marijuana, and 
                    an earthly scent. When I stepped out of my apartment building 
                    and was about to attend one of my evening classes, I noticed the smell
                    of the fresh and clean air after a rain storm flushed everything away 
                    30 minutes ago. I enjoyed this rare moment in New York's fresh 
                    air. But not long after, I scented cigarette smoke and 
                    marijuana odor, a familiar reminder that I 
                    was in New York.</p>

                <h3>Reminder of Home </h3>
            </div>
            <div class="Text">
                <p>In Hong Kong, where I grew up, we 
                    have a lot of rain during summer. I would 
                    say I spent almost half of my summer carrying an 
                    umbrella just in case it started to pour rain. Therefore,
                    I have many memories associated with the smell of rain, most of 
                    which are delightful memories. My home in Hong Kong is on a hill. It 
                    is a small and quiet hill with a relatively low population. Because of that, 
                    there are tons of trees, plants, stray cats and dogs, and even wild animals 
                    like monkeys living on the hill (sometimes they even swim in the pool of 
                    our building). So you can imagine whenever it rains, there is always a 
                    strong earthy scent in the air. Now, whenever I encounter the smell of 
                    rain, it reminds me of the rainy days in Hong Kong when I would be 
                    sitting on a couch, listening to the sound of the rain, and 
                    enjoying this pleasant moment. </p>
