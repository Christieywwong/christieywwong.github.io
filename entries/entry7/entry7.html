        <h4>SMELL OF BUBBLE TEA SHOP</h4>
        <p>30% FRESHLY BREWED TEA<br>
            23% CREAMY MILK OR CREAMER<br>
            28% SWEET SUGAR OR SYRUP<br>
            6% TAPIOCA PEARLS<br>
            13% FRUITY AND REFRESHING NOTES</p>

        <h4>100% HAPPINESS</h4>
        <p> BACK WHEN I WAS IN BOARDING SCHOOL IN TORONTO, WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE SCHOOL EXCEPT FOR WEEKENDS. PLUS, NONE OF MY FRIENDS OR I HAD OUR DRIVER'S LICENSES OR A CAR, SO THE TIME WE COULD SPEND OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL WAS VERY LIMITED. SO WHENEVER WE GOT A CHANCE, WE WOULD STAY OUT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH WE HAD NOTHING TO DO.
            <br><br>
            SINCE GRADE 11, MY FRIENDS AND I HAD HAD A WEEKLY PLAN ON FRIDAY NIGHT THAT WE EITHER ORDER FOOD DELIVERY (WHICH WAS NOT ALLOWED DURING WEEKDAYS AS WELL) OR GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO HANG OUT. AND A LOT OF THE TIME, WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE, WE HAD TO GRAB BUBBLE TEA BEFORE GOING BACK, WHICH BECAME OUR HABIT UNTIL WE GRADUATED.
            <br><br>
            SO NOW, WHENEVER I ENTER A BUBBLE TEA SHOP, THE SMELL OF MILK AND BREWED TEA ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF THE WEEKENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT I SPENT WITH MY FRIENDS, WHICH IS DEFINITELY SOME OF MY GREATEST MEMORIES THAT I WOULD NEVER FORGET.        </p>
