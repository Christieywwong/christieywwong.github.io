        <h4>SMELL OF BUBBLE TEA SHOP</h4>
        <p>30% Freshly Brewed Tea<br>
            23% Creamy Milk or Creamer<br>
            28% Sweet Sugar or Syrup<br>
            6% Tapioca Pearls<br>
            13% Fruity and Refreshing Notes</p>

        <h4>100% HAPPINESS</h4>
        <p> Back when I was in boarding school in Toronto, we were not allowed to leave school except for weekends. Plus, none of my friends or I had our driver's licenses or a car, so the time we could spend outside of school was very limited. So whenever we got a chance, we would stay out as long as possible even though we had nothing to do.
            <br><br>
            Since grade 11, my friends and I had had a weekly plan on Friday night that we either order food delivery (which was not allowed during weekdays as well) or go somewhere else to hang out. And a lot of the time, when we were outside, we had to grab bubble tea before going back, which became our habit until we graduated. 
            <br><br>
            So now, whenever I enter a bubble tea shop, the smell of milk and brewed tea always reminds me of the weekends in high school that I spent with my friends, which is definitely some of my greatest memories that I would never forget.
