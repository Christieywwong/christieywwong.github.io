        <p> Mimosa, also known as Acacia or Silver Wattle, produces flowers in various colors, including yellow, pink, 
            white, and red. It is well-known for its beautiful yellow blossoms, the most common color of flower 
            produced by this species. The yellow mimosa is native to Australia and commonly seen in forests, woodlands, 
            and along watercourses. The mimosa flower has one of the most delicate, pleasant, and sweet scent, often described 
            as honey-like.

            <h2>MIMOSA HAND SOAP</h2>
            <p>When searching for a hand soap for my home in New York a few weeks ago, I came across this hand soap 
                from Zara Home on the internet. I ordered it after reading the description without having an expectation
                of how it would smell. The description goes, "A floral aroma that transports you to a field full of 
                beautiful mimosa flowers. The delicate floral touches surrounded by an aromatic burst of cardamom and 
                eucalyptus combine with the colourful essence of mimosa..."
            </p>
            <h2>STORY BEHIND</h2>
            <p>If I were to compare my childhood to a scent, mimosa, it would undoubtedly be the scent of mimosa, an 
                extremely familiar aroma that always brings me back to my childhood. Since my grandparents lived very 
                close to my family, we visited them almost every day back then. At their place, there were and still are 
                some very strict rules we had to follow. For example, we have to wear slippers inside and remove them before 
                stepping on the carpet. But the one rule that sticks out is handwashing. My grandma would catch us, who 
                tried to skip it, saying, "You must wash your hands before you eat." I remember that she loved a particular 
                hand soap that smelled like mimosa, which she kept repurchasing again and again. So now, whenever I come across 
                that specific mimosa scent, I automatically think of my grandma and her favorite hand soap.<br></p>
