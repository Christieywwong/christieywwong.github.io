                Growing up in an Asian household, I have always been a rice girl. I love a bowl of 
                good fried rice as it is arguably one of the most common dishes in my family. 
                When away from home or my family, I am constantly craving some rice dishes
                ALL THE TIME (almost every day). So last week, my friend and I went to a very 
                popular Thai restaurant, 
            <a class="pranakhon-link" href="https://pranakhonnyc.com/" target="_blank">Pranakhon</a> 
                which has been on my list for a year as a 
                little treat for ourselves after a long week of school. 
                <br><br>
                As we pushed the door and entered the restaurant, we could already smell a 
                strong aroma of Thai curry. We waited and got seated by the host, and I decided 
                to order the crab fried rice on the menu, and out of my expectation, it tasted 
                and smelt so good. The most noticeable smell was from its pungent garlic and 
                onions and a subtle oceanic aroma from the crab meat and the sauce.

            <p>The whole dinning experience and environment brought up my memory from my 
            Thailand trip before COVID hit. In December 2019, I joined a two-week school 
            trip to Thailand, where we spent about ten days in Chang Mai and six days in 
            Bangkok. During the trip, I had the opportunity to try different Thai dishes, and 
            my favorite was the fried rice made by my homestay host in Chang Mai. I am 
            sure it is some sort of a homemade recipe because I have never eaten fried rice 
            that is so special (or maybe just because I am used to eating Chinese fried rice,
            not Thai fried rice). </p>
